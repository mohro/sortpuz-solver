### Sort Puz solver. 

1. ~~Inefficient algorithm implementation~~
2. 3x4 Problem requires 90 moves with brute force. Manual solution is possible in ~10 moves.
3. ~~Add toString to tubes.~~
4. Record successful steps and return as solution.
5. Simulate case where randomness leads to unsolvable state. Only way to solve is to try a different variation
